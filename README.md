# Keyed Services in .NET

This repository contains the source code for my blog post on [Keyed Services in .NET](https://wntech.hashnode.dev/keyed-services-dotnet-8).  
The project demonstrates how to resolve multiple implementations of the same interface using **.NET 8 Keyed Services**, without resorting to manual factories or complex DI hacks.

### Available API Endpoints

- **POST** `/api/Payment/oldway`  
  Uses the traditional factory approach.

- **POST** `/api/Payment/keyed`  
  Uses the new **.NET 8 Keyed Services** approach.

---

### Request Payload

Both endpoints expect a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "provider": "Stripe",
  "amount": 100
}
```

You can change "provider" to "PayPal" also.
